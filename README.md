# Machine Learning Tutorials for Beginners

## Project Overview
As a Machine Learning instructor and mentor, this repository contains the notebooks and resources used during my teaching sessions for motivated students and beginners in machine learning. Each notebook is designed to introduce fundamental concepts, guide students through hands-on coding exercises, and demonstrate real-world applications of machine learning algorithms.
