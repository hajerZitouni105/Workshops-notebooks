    "#### `1) One Hot Encoding :` \n",
    "This technique is used to convert a categorical variable with 'n' categories into 'n' binary columns. Each binary column represents a single category, and the value is set to 1 if the category is present and 0 otherwise. <br>\n",
    "    - Dummy var trap : twali n-1 , 5ater najmou n7otou 0 f n-1 col ma3neha rahi 1 f nieme col<br>\n",
    "    - Disadvantages : ki yabda 3ndk baaarcha categ implique baarcha columns jdod (dimension tziid) \n",
    "\n",
    "#### `2) One Hot Encoding with many categorical variables :` \n",
    "Ta5tar Akther 10 (par exple) yet3awdou w te5dm 3lihom houma khw el one hot encoding \n",
    "\n",
    "#### `3) Mean Encoding / Target Encoding :` \n",
    "This technique replaces each category with the mean of the --target variable-- for that category. This can be useful when the target variable is continuous and the goal is to predict its value.   \n",
    "\n",
    "#### `4) Count Encoding / Frequency Encoding :` \n",
    "This technique involves replacing each category with the number of times it appears in the dataset. <br>\n",
    "This technique replaces each category with its frequency or occurrence in the dataset. This can be useful for categorical variables with high cardinality. <br>\n",
    "Disadvantage : It will provide same weight if the frequencies are same\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `5) Binary Encoding:`\n",
    "This technique is similar to One-Hot Encoding but with the added benefit of reducing the number of columns required. Each category is assigned a unique binary code, and these codes are used to create the encoded columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `6) Hash Encoding:`\n",
    "This technique is used to reduce the dimensionality of high cardinality categorical variables. Each category is hashed to a fixed-length code, which is used as the encoded value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `7) Probability Ratio Encoding:`\n",
    "Example : \n",
    "1. Prob of Survived based on Cabin (Categorical Feature)\n",
    "2. Prob of Not Survived [1-pr(Survived)]\n",
    "3. Pr(Survived)/pr(Not Survived)\n",
    "4. Dictonary to map cabin with prob\n",
    "5. Replace with the categorical feature"
